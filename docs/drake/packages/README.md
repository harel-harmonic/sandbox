This example project explores R package download trends, and it is paired with a [chapter of the user manual](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/example-packages.html). Except for `interactive-tutorial.R`, the files here show how to set up a `drake` project. Run `make.R` to run or update the whole workflow, and read the output `report.md` file to see the results. In practice, you do not need to use the file structure provided, but it does happen to be a reasonable way of doing things.
