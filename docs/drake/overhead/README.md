This workflow is designed to maximize overhead and stress-test drake. 
The goal is to improve drake's internals so this example runs fast.

Let n be the number of targets. 
There are n * (n - 1) / 2 non-file dependency connections among all the targets, 
which is the maximum possible. 
For i = 2, ..., n, target i depends on targets 1 through i - 1.
